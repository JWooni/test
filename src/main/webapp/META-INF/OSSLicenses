 *                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 * 
 *  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 *  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 *  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 *  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 * 
 * [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 *  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 *  the version number 2.1.]
 * 
 *                             Preamble
 * 
 *   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 * freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 * Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 * free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 * 
 *   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 * specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 * Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 * can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 * this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 * strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 * 
 *   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 * not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 * you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 * for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 * it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 * it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 * these things.
 * 
 *   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 * distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 * rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 * you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 * 
 *   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 * or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 * you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 * code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 * complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 * with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 * it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 * 
 *   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 * library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 * permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 * 
 *   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 * there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 * modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 * that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 * author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 * introduced by others.
 * 
 *   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 * any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 * effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 * restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 * any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 * consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 * 
 *   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 * ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 * General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 * is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 * this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 * libraries into non-free programs.
 * 
 *   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 * a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 * combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 * General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 * entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 * Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 * the library.
 * 
 *   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 * does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 * Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 * of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 * are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 * libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 * special circumstances.
 * 
 *   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 * encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 * a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 * allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 * library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 * case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 * software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 * 
 *   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 * programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 * free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 * non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 * operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 * system.
 * 
 *   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 * users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 * linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 * that program using a modified version of the Library.
 * 
 *   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 * modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 * "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 * former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 * be combined with the library in order to run.
 * 
 *                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 * 
 *   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 * program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 * other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 * this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 * Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 * 
 *   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 * prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 * (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 * 
 *   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 * which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 * Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 * copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 * portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 * straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 * included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 * 
 *   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 * making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 * all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 * interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 * and installation of the library.
 * 
 *   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 * running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 * such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 * on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 * writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 * and what the program that uses the Library does.
 * 
 *   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 * complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 * you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 * appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 * all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 * warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 * Library.
 * 
 *   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 * and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 * fee.
 * 
 *   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 * of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 * distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 * above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 * 
 *     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 * 
 *     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 * 
 *     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 *     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 * 
 *     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 *     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 *     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 *     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 *     in the event an application does not supply such function or
 *     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 *     its purpose remains meaningful.
 * 
 *     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 *     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 *     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 *     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 *     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 *     root function must still compute square roots.)
 * 
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 * and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 * on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 * this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 * entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 * it.
 * 
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 * collective works based on the Library.
 * 
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 * with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 * a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 * the scope of this License.
 * 
 *   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 * License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 * this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 * that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 * instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 * ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 * that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 * these notices.
 * 
 *   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 * that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 * subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 * 
 *   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 * the Library into a program that is not a library.
 * 
 *   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 * derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 * under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 * it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 * must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 * medium customarily used for software interchange.
 * 
 *   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 * from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 * source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 * distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 * compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 * 
 *   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 * Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 * linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 * work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 * therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 * 
 *   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 * creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 * contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 * library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 * Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 * 
 *   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 * that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 * derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 * Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 * linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 * threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 * 
 *   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 * structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 * functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 * file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 * work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 * Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 * 
 *   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 * distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 * Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 * whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 * 
 *   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 * link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 * work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 * under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 * modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 * engineering for debugging such modifications.
 * 
 *   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 * Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 * this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 * during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 * copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 * directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 * of these things:
 * 
 *     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 *     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 *     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 *     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 *     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 *     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 *     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 *     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 *     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 *     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 *     to use the modified definitions.)
 * 
 *     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 *     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 *     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 *     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 *     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 *     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 *     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 * 
 *     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 *     least three years, to give the same user the materials
 *     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 *     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 * 
 *     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 *     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 *     specified materials from the same place.
 * 
 *     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 *     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 * 
 *   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 * Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 * reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 * the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 * normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 * components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 * which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 * the executable.
 * 
 *   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 * restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 * accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 * use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 * distribute.
 * 
 *   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 * Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 * facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 * library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 * the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 * permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 * 
 *     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 *     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 *     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 *     Sections above.
 * 
 *     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 *     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 *     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 * 
 *   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 * the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 * attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 * distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 * rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 * or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 * terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 * 
 *   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 * signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 * distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 * modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 * Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 * all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 * the Library or works based on it.
 * 
 *   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 * Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 * original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 * subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 * restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 * You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 * this License.
 * 
 *   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 * distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 * may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 * license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 * all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 * the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 * refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 * 
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 * particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 * and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 * 
 * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 * integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 * implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 * generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 * through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 * system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 * to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 * impose that choice.
 * 
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 * be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 * 
 *   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 * original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 * an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 * so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 * excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 * written in the body of this License.
 * 
 *   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 * versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 * Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 * but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 * 
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 * "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 * conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 * the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 * license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 * the Free Software Foundation.
 * 
 *   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 * programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 * write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 * copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 * Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 * decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 * of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 * and reuse of software generally.
 * 
 *                             NO WARRANTY
 * 
 *   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 * WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 * EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 * OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 * KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 * IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 * PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 * LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 * THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 * 
 *   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 * WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 * AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 * FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 * CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 * LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 * RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 * FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 * SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 * DAMAGES.
 * 
 *                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 * 
 *            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 * 
 *   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 * possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 * everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 * redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 * ordinary General Public License).
 * 
 *   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 * safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 * convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 * "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 * 
 *     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 *     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 * 
 *     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 *     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 *     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 *     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 * 
 *     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 *     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 *     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 *     Lesser General Public License for more details.
 * 
 *     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 *     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 *     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 * 
 * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 * 
 * You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 * school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 * necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 * 
 *   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
 *   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
 * 
 *   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
 *   Ty Coon, President of Vice
 * 
 * That's all there is to it!

/**************************************                       *********************************/
/* ============================================================================================
 * Oracle Technology Network License Agreement
 * 
 * Oracle is willing to authorize Your access to software associated with this License Agreement (“Agreement”) only upon the condition that You accept that this Agreement governs Your use of the software. By selecting the “Accept License Agreement” button or box (or the equivalent) or installing or using the Programs You indicate Your acceptance of this Agreement and Your agreement, as an authorized representative of Your company or organization (if being acquired for use by an entity) or as an individual, to comply with the license terms that apply to the software that You wish to download and access. If You are not willing to be bound by this Agreement, do not select the “Accept License Agreement” button or box (or the equivalent) and do not download or access the software.
 * 
 * Definitions 
 * "Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to (a) a company or organization (each an “Entity”) accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b) an individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will not be on behalf of an Entity. “Contractors” refers to Your agents and contractors (including, without limitation, outsourcers). "Program(s)" refers to Oracle software provided by Oracle pursuant to this Agreement and any updates, error corrections, and/or Program Documentation provided by Oracle. “Program Documentation” refers to Program user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed from www.oracle.com/documentation. “Associated Product” refers to the Oracle product(s), if any, and as identified in the Programs documentation or on the Programs download site, with which the Programs are intended to enable or enhance interoperation with Your application(s). “Separate Terms” refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files and that apply to Separately Licensed Third Party Technology. “Separately Licensed Third Party Technology” refers to third party technology that is licensed under Separate Terms and not under the terms of this Agreement.
 * 
 * License Rights and Restrictions
 * Oracle grants You a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license to, subject to the restrictions stated in this Agreement, (a) internally use the Programs solely for the purposes of developing, testing, prototyping and demonstrating Your applications, and running the Programs for Your own internal business operations; and (b) redistribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation pursuant to the Programs Redistribution section below. You may allow Your Contractor(s) to use the Programs, provided they are acting on Your behalf to exercise license rights granted in this Agreement and further provided that You are responsible for their compliance with this Agreement in such use. You will have a written agreement with Your Contractor(s) that strictly limits their right to use the Programs and that otherwise protects Oracle’s intellectual property rights to the same extent as this Agreement. You may make copies of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary to exercise the license rights granted in this Agreement. You may make one copy of the Programs for backup purposes.
 * 
 * Further, You may not:
 * 
 * remove or modify any Program markings or any notice of Oracle’s or a licensor’s proprietary rights;
 * use the Programs to provide third party training unless Oracle expressly authorizes such use on the Program’s download page;
 * assign this Agreement or distribute, give, or transfer the Programs or an interest in them to any third party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement (the foregoing shall not be construed to limit the rights You may otherwise have with respect to Separately Licensed Third Party Technology);
 * cause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the Programs; and
 * disclose results of any Program benchmark tests without Oracle’s prior consent.
 * The Programs may contain source code that, unless expressly licensed in this Agreement for other purposes (for example, licensed under an open source license), is provided solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and may not be modified.
 * 
 * All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Oracle. If You want to use the Programs or Your application for any purpose other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement, You must obtain from Oracle or an Oracle reseller a valid Programs license under a separate agreement permitting such use. However, You acknowledge that the Programs may not be intended for production use and/or Oracle may not make a version of the Programs available for production or other purposes; any development or other work You undertake with the Programs is at Your sole risk.
 * 
 * Programs Redistribution 
 * We grant You a nonexclusive, nontransferable right to copy and distribute unmodified Programs and Programs Documentation as part of and included in Your application that is intended to interoperate with the Associated Product, if any, provided that You do not charge Your end users any additional fees for the use of the Programs. Prior to distributing the Programs and Programs Documentation, You shall require Your end users to execute an agreement binding them to terms, with respect to the Programs and Programs Documentation, materially consistent and no less restrictive than those contained in this section and the sections of this Agreement entitled “License Rights and Restrictions” (except that the redistribution right granted to You shall not be included; Your end users may not distribute Programs and Programs Documentation to any third parties), "Ownership," "Export Controls," "Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability," "No Technical Support" (with respect to Oracle support; You may provide Your own support for Programs at Your discretion), "Audit; Termination (except that Oracle’s audit right shall not be included)," "Relationship Between the Parties," and “U.S. Government End Users.” You must also include a provision stating that Your end users shall have no right to distribute the Programs and Programs Documentation, and a provision specifying us as a third party beneficiary of the agreement. You are responsible for obtaining these agreements with Your end users.
 * 
 * You agree to: (a) defend and indemnify us against all claims and damages caused by Your distribution of the Programs and Programs Documentation in breach of this Agreement and/or failure to include the required contractual provisions in Your end user agreement as stated above; (b) keep executed end user agreements and records of end user information including name, address, date of distribution and identity of Programs distributed; (c) allow us to inspect Your end user agreements and records upon request; and, (d) enforce the terms of Your end user agreements so as to effect a timely cure of any end user breach, and to notify us of any breach of the terms.
 * 
 * Ownership
 * Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Programs.
 * 
 * Third-Party Technology 
 * The Programs may contain or require the use of third party technology that is provided with the Programs. Oracle may provide certain notices to You in Program Documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party technology. Third party technology will be licensed to You either under the terms of this Agreement or, if specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files, under Separate Terms. Your rights to use Separately Licensed Third Party Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by this Agreement. However, for clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Third Party Technology shall be deemed part of the Programs and is licensed to You under the terms of this Agreement.
 * 
 * Source Code for Open Source Software 
 * For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is licensed under an open source license that gives You the right to receive the source code for that binary, You can obtain a copy of the applicable source code from https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. If the source code for such software was not provided to You with the binary, You can also receive a copy of the source code on physical media by submitting a written request pursuant to the instructions in the "Written Offer for Source Code" section of the latter website.
 * 
 * Export Controls 
 * Export laws and regulations of the United States and any other relevant local export laws and regulations apply to the Programs . You agree that such export control laws govern Your use of the Programs (including technical data) and any services deliverables provided under this agreement, and You agree to comply with all such export laws and regulations (including "deemed export" and "deemed re-export" regulations). You agree that no data, information, program and/or materials resulting from Programs or services (or direct products thereof) will be exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation, or development of missile technology. Accordingly, You confirm:
 * 
 * You will not download, provide, make available or otherwise export or re-export the Programs, directly or indirectly, to countries prohibited by applicable laws and regulations nor to citizens, nationals or residents of those countries.
 * You are not listed on the United States Department of Treasury lists of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, Specially Designated Terrorists, and Specially Designated Narcotic Traffickers, nor are You listed on the United States Department of Commerce Table of Denial Orders.
 * You will not download or otherwise export or re-export the Programs, directly or indirectly, to persons on the above mentioned lists.
 * You will not use the Programs for, and will not allow the Programs to be used for, any purposes prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation, for the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction.
 * Information Collection 
 * The Programs’ installation and/or auto-update processes, if any, may transmit a limited amount of data to Oracle or its service provider about those processes to help Oracle understand and optimize them. Oracle does not associate the data with personally identifiable information. Refer to Oracle’s Privacy Policy at www.oracle.com/privacy.
 * 
 * Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability
 * 
 * THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ORACLE FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT .
 * 
 * IN NO EVENT WILL ORACLE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF ORACLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ORACLE’S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000) .
 * 
 * No Technical Support 
 * Unless Oracle support for the Programs, if any, is expressly included in a separate, current support agreement between You and Oracle, Oracle’s technical support organization will not provide technical support, phone support, or updates to You for the Programs provided under this Agreement.
 * 
 * Audit; Termination 
 * Oracle may audit Your use of the Programs. You may terminate this Agreement by destroying all copies of the Programs. This Agreement shall automatically terminate without notice if You fail to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement, in which case You shall promptly destroy all copies of the Programs.
 * 
 * U.S. Government End Users 
 * Programs and/or Programs Documentation delivered to U.S. Government end users are “commercial computer software” pursuant to the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency-specific supplemental regulations. As such, use, duplication, disclosure, modification, and adaptation of the Programs and/or Programs Documentation shall be subject to the license terms and license restrictions set forth in this Agreement. No other rights are granted to the U.S. Government.
 * 
 * Relationship Between the Parties 
 * Oracle is an independent contractor and we agree that no partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship exists between us. We each will be responsible for paying our own employees, including employment related taxes and insurance.. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
 * 
 * Entire Agreement; Governing Law 
 * You agree that this Agreement is the complete agreement for the Programs and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, including any clickwrap, shrinkwrap or similar licenses, or license agreements for prior versions of the Programs. This Agreement may not be modified and the rights and restrictions may not be altered or waived except in a writing signed by authorized representatives of You and of Oracle. If any term of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.
 * 
 * This Agreement is governed by the substantive and procedural laws of the State of California, USA, and You and Oracle agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of San Francisco or Santa Clara counties in California in any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
 * 
 * Notices 
 * Should you have any questions concerning this License Agreement, or if you desire to contact Oracle for any reason, please write:
 * 
 * Oracle America, Inc. 
 * 500 Oracle Parkway 
 * Redwood City, CA 94065
 * 
 * Oracle Employees: Under no circumstances are Oracle Employees authorized to download software for the purpose of distributing it to customers. Oracle products are available to employees for internal use or demonstration purposes only. In keeping with Oracle's trade compliance obligations under U.S. and applicable multilateral law, failure to comply with this policy could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.
